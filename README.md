🪐 Exoplanet Classifier 🪐 

Built for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025 (Oct 4–5)

An AI-powered tool that uses NASA’s Kepler mission data to classify potential exoplanets as:

🟢 CONFIRMED EXOPLANET — Definitely a planet

🟡 PLANETORY CANDIDATE — Likely a planet, not yet confirmed

🔴 FALSE POSITIVE — Not a planet (signal caused by something else)

Built with Scikit-learn and Streamlit, the tool lets users explore real exoplanet data, visualize feature importance, and interactively classify new observations — bringing AI and space science together in an accessible way.
